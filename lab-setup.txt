Lab setup for Network Automation Webinar
========================================

Management Host / Ansible Host
==============================
Linux in VM
Linux CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)
Python 2.7.5
Ansible 2.3.1, including Cisco ACI modules

Network Device
==============
Cisco ACI Fabric (SW Version 3.0.1(k))
2-Pods, 3 APIC
2 spines and 2 leafs per Pod

This is a rather small lab, containing only one network device.
There are 2 main use cases we are working on for network automation:
- Inventory + logical topology
- Service provisioning

The inventory/logical topology is used to get an simple overview of configured tenants including VRFs, Bridge Domains (BDs), Application Profiles (APs) and endpoint gropus (EPGs).
Additionally this can be used to check settings within BDs and EPGs and check for compliance with recommended and standard values.

Service provisioning entails the setup for a new environment for a customer or project.
The default environment consists of:
1 Tenant
n VRFs, usually 1-2, but might be more
n Bridge Domains, each attached to one of the VRFs
n Application Profiles
n Endpoint groups, each attached to one AP and one BD
1 physical domain that will be attached to every EPG
n Ports that will be attached to an EPG to connect to external devices, e.g. UCS Chassis, Loadbalancer, Firewall
